# custom-inspections

This android app was created to fulfill a business idea by my father. He used to be a residential Home Inspector, and knew about the money available in the service. However, instead of running a company, he thought he could create his own sole-proprietorship. This app was designed to allow him to create his own inspection process, but make it incredibly efficient, and located in one device. Scheduling, Inspecting, and Finalizing; from beginning to finish of every inspection, all on one app.

This app was a huge learning project, so hyper-efficient coding practices, or even architecture isn't perfect. The project was attempted to be organized using OOP. I utilized comments to explain the more complex classes.

This project is a continous learning project, and I think it is turning out fantastic despite not being 'up to standard.' This app is still a work-in-progress, but has a lot of core-functionality completed. Let's go over it!

The start of every inspection is the scheduling process, and this app handles it seamlessly.

Additionally, the user can remove a schedule in the case it gets cancelled, or the inspection is completed.

Upon opening the first-ever inspection, the user will be introduced to the "inspection-hub." This Activity provides access to the tools to inspect residences.
Without prior configuration, the custom-coded "Front" system is the only system available. There are also buttons to upload data and create the PDF; which we will come back to later.
